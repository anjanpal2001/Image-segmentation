# Image Classification and Segmentation using Deep Learning (U-Net Model)

Image classification and segmentation are two fundamental tasks in computer vision. **Image classification** involves assigning a class label to an entire image, whereas **image segmentation** involves classifying each individual pixel in the image to generate a detailed map of object boundaries.

In recent years, **deep learning** has revolutionized these tasks by enabling automatic feature extraction and achieving state-of-the-art results. One of the most prominent architectures for **semantic segmentation** is the **U-Net model**, originally proposed for biomedical image segmentation.

## U-Net Architecture

The U-Net model is a type of **convolutional neural network (CNN)** with an **encoder-decoder structure**:

- **Encoder (Contracting Path):** Captures the context of the image by progressively downsampling using convolutional and pooling layers.
- **Decoder (Expanding Path):** Reconstructs spatial information and refines segmentation maps using transposed convolutions (up-convolutions).
- **Skip Connections:** Directly connect corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder to preserve spatial information lost during downsampling.

This architecture allows U-Net to perform well even with limited annotated data, making it ideal for medical and biological image segmentation tasks.

## Advantages of U-Net in Segmentation Tasks

- Preserves high-resolution details through skip connections.
- Performs well with small datasets.
- Accurate boundary detection in segmented regions.
- End-to-end training and pixel-level predictions.

## Applications

- Medical imaging (e.g., tumor or organ segmentation)
- Satellite imagery analysis
- Agricultural monitoring
- Cell and tissue analysis in microscopy
- Autonomous driving (road, vehicle, and pedestrian segmentation)
